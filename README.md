# Real Estate Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing using Python on a real-world Chennai real estate dataset. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as sale price, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

## Objective
To clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis and visualization, focusing on:
- Handling missing values
- Date format conversion
- Feature engineering (e.g., property age, price per sqft)
- Exporting a cleaned CSV for downstream use

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
